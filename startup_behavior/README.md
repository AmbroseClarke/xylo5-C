# xylo5-c Startup Behavior #

This directory contains analysis of the activity on the xylo5-c when power is
applied.  The most obvious behavior is that all LEDs flash briefly when the
battery is inserted.  The activity of the LED driver and SPI bus are analyzed
here.

## SPI ##

The SPI traffic is analyzed in this forum thread (and also a separate thread
linked from this one):
[http://xylobandhacking.freeforums.net/thread/19/spi-traffic-on-startup](http://xylobandhacking.freeforums.net/thread/19/spi-traffic-on-startup)

The captured data is also included in the SPI directory in case the forum goes
down:
[SPI/](./SPI/)

## LEDs ##

TODO (scope captures are in the LED directory but not yet summarized)
