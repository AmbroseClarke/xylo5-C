# Xylobands xylo5-C

This repo contains info on the Xylobands LED wristbands which use the xylo5-C
PCB version.  The xylo5-C is the type used on Coldplay's Head Full of Dreams
tour in the US.

## Contents

* [schematic/](./schematic/) - Schematic for the PCB, created by tracing connections visually 
and with a multimeter.  The schematic is very messy because it is laid out to
match the PCB layout as closely as possible.  A PDF version is also included.
* [PCB/](./PCB) - Photos of the PCB along with a spreadsheet listing every component on
the front side of the board and its location (using the photo with a grid for
reference).
* [startup_behavior/](./startup_behavior/) - Summary of the activity on the xylo5-c
when power is applied (LED / SPI activity).

## Stuff Not Included

* Datasheets.  Because I don't know the legality of copying datasheets, I didn't
include any in this repo.  All of the major components have easily accessible
datasheets - all you need to do is search the part number.
